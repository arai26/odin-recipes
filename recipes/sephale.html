    <h1>Description</h1>
    <p>Sephale is a traditional Nepali stuffed bread, often enjoyed as a snack or light meal. The dough is made from all-purpose flour, water, and a pinch of salt, kneaded into a soft, pliable texture. It is then rolled out into small discs, filled with a savory mixture of minced meat (usually chicken, pork, or buffalo), finely chopped onions, garlic, ginger, and spices like cumin and coriander. Once filled, the dough is folded and sealed, creating a half-moon shape. The stuffed bread is then deep-fried until golden and crispy on the outside, while the inside remains juicy and flavorful. Sephale is typically served hot, accompanied by a tangy tomato chutney or achar, enhancing its rich, savory taste.<p>
