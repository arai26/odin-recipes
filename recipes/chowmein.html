    <h1>Description</h1>

    <p>Nepali chowmein is a popular street food dish featuring stir-fried noodles with a medley of vibrant vegetables and savory flavors. The dish starts with boiled and drained chowmein noodles, which are then stir-fried with a mix of chopped onions, bell peppers, carrots, and cabbage. For protein, you can add chicken, beef, or tofu, all sautéed until cooked through. The seasoning includes soy sauce, a dash of vinegar, and a hint of chili sauce for a touch of heat. Garlic and ginger are sautéed for aromatic depth, and the dish is finished with a sprinkle of fresh cilantro or green onions. This flavorful, slightly spicy dish is often enjoyed hot, offering a satisfying balance of textures and tastes.</p>
